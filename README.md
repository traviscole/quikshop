CEN3031

Quikshop is designed to help users/customers have a convenient way of shopping that does not require them to stand in line
for an extended period of time but allows them to do their shopping without the hassle of knowing they will have to wait 
before they can leave. The database that will be implemented will hold all of the information for customers so all that 
really needs to be done is scan an item and place it in a cart.
